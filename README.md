## 🚩 Problem Statement
Hackathon participants often struggle with **time management, uneven task distribution, and poor coordination**.  
Most of the 24 hours are spent setting up environments, dividing work, and fixing communication issues rather than innovating.  
This leads to **incomplete prototypes, stress, and lost creativity**.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
**SkillForge** acts as an **AI-powered teammate** that automates hackathon project management.  
It intelligently analyzes each member’s skills and helps the team build faster through automation and smart suggestions.

### 🧠 What SkillForge Does
- **Skill Mapping:** Understands team members’ strengths and assigns roles automatically.  
- **AutoFlow Engine:** Creates project roadmap and organizes the workflow.  
- **Smart Assist:** Provides real-time AI coding help, debugging, and idea refinement.  
- **Pitch Mode:** Generates a hackathon-ready presentation based on project data.

By automating repetitive tasks, SkillForge lets teams focus purely on **creativity and innovation**.
